# Oregon-Trail-Fortran-77-Edition
A source port of the 1978 version of The Oregon Trail to FORTRAN 77, originally created in HP time-shared BASIC by Don Rawitsch, Bill Heinemann, and Paul Dillenberger:

This program simulates a trip over the Oregon trail from Independence, Missouri to Oregon City, Oregon in 1847. Your family of five will cover the 2040 mile Oregon trail in 5 to 6 months -- if you make it alive.

The BASIC source code was first published in Creative Computing magazine in 1978. Ports of the game exist for various platforms. For instance, Westward Ho! is an adaption by David H. Ahl for his book BASIC Computer Adventures that was also released for MS-DOS.

The remake in FORTRAN tries to stay close to the gameplay of the BASIC version but some changes to input handling and output formatting had to be made.
